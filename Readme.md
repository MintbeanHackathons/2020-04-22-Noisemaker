## Tech Used

Decided to code in just HTML, JS, and CSS today. I've been using React for everything and I am worried I am forgetting the core concepts of front end. Hopefully this doesn't backfire on me. Tone.js library was used for creating sounds. Bulma CSS framework was used for styling. Flavicon.io was used to generate the flavicon.
